# Schema-Based Content Generation

Modern large language models (LLMs) no longer just generate text — they construct ideas, shape tones, and balance analytical and emotional registers.

In this new paradigm, the way an AI thinks and expresses itself is programmable.

`content-llm-builder-schema.v0.1` introduces a structured approach to this challenge —
a meta-semantic configuration framework that defines how AI systems compose, reason, and present ideas.

This schema is not just a data model; it is an ontological control layer for expression —
it transforms free-form generation into intentional authorship.

# General Definition

[content-llm-builder-schema.v0.1](https://lumgoo.com/posts/content-llm-builder-schemav01) is a JSON-based configuration schema that defines every possible dimension of content generation.

> Defines all possible content configuration keys, their allowed values, and output control rules for the LLM content builder.

Its purpose is to provide a unified way to govern the tone, structure, logic, and philosophy of AI-generated content — turning abstract prompts into reproducible, auditable creative outputs.

# Structural Overview

The schema consists of two primary layers:

1. `keys` — declarative parameters controlling what and how the model writes.
2. `output_rules` — behavioral constraints governing how the output is delivered.

Together, these layers create a flexible yet deterministic framework for AI composition.

# Foundational Dimensions

## Content Classification

Defines the intellectual domain and thematic scope of the piece.

- `category`: Science, Philosophy, Culture, Fiction, etc.
- `subcategory`: Astrophysics, AI Ethics, Existentialism, Behavioral Economics, etc.

This provides an epistemic boundary — telling the LLM not only what to discuss, but from which disciplinary perspective to approach it.

## Tone and Intent (tone, intent)

These parameters shape the emotional and rhetorical signature of the text.

- `tone`: defines emotional temperature (Warm, Tragic, Analytical).
- `intent`: defines communicative purpose (Inform, Inspire, Critique, Educate).

For instance, an Analytical + Educate pairing yields an academic essay,
while Hopeful + Inspire produces a visionary manifesto.

## Cognitive Frameworks (belief_system, logic_mode, causality_mode)

This cluster encodes the thinking style of the authoring AI.

| Key              | Description               | Examples                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `belief_system`  | Underlying worldview      | _Materialist, Humanist, Mystic_         |
| `logic_mode`     | Reasoning style           | _Rational, Intuitive, Mythic_           |
| `causality_mode` | Model of cause and effect | _Deterministic, Probabilistic, Chaotic_ |

> This triad effectively defines the “philosophical personality” of the model —
> a Materialist–Empirical mode writes like a scientist,
> whereas an Idealist–Mythic mode writes like a poet or theologian.

## Temporal and Philosophical Depth

- `temporal_focus`: the timeframe (Past, Present, Future, Timeless).
- `philosophical_depth`: conceptual granularity (Surface → Existential).

For example, “Future + Deep” yields a speculative futurist essay,
whereas “Past + Moderate” produces a historical reflection.

# Form and Reader Experience

## Structural Dimensions

Define how information is architected and delivered.

- `format`: Essay, Article, Report, Dialogue, Manifesto
- `structure_style`: Narrative, Analytical, Chronological, Q&A
- `style`: Poetic, Journalistic, Reflective, Satirical

Together, they specify the rhetorical geometry of the output.

## Experiential Dimensions

These control the aesthetic perception of the text. This level transforms content from “informational” to “experiential.”

| Parameter            | Role                                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reading_experience` | Defines the reader’s cognitive mode (_Educational, Immersive, Meditative_) |
| `imagery_density`    | Visual richness (_Low → High_)                                             |
| `sentence_rhythm`    | Flow of phrasing (_Slow → Dynamic_)                                        |
| `sound_design`       | Phonetic texture (_Soft, Percussive, Flowing_)                             |

# Ethics, Agency, and Conscious Stance

## agency

Determines who acts in the narrative —
is it Human, System, Nature, Machine, or Unknown?

In philosophical essays, this clarifies whether the AI writes as an observer, a participant, or a systemic voice.

## ethical_stance

Sets the moral tone of the argument.

Values such as Neutral, Humanistic, Critical, Eco-centric, and Utilitarian
guide how the text evaluates human and non-human actors.

# Output Control (output_rules)

This section governs how the AI delivers its text.
It defines behavioral, stylistic, and linguistic constraints to ensure predictability.
Through these, a generative model becomes a governed expression system rather than a stochastic storyteller.

| Rule                    | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plain_text_only`       | Strips all prefaces and assistant phrases                       |
| `no_preface_or_closing` | Removes “Sure, here’s your article…” style framing              |
| `omit_metadata`         | Hides tone or word-count annotations                            |
| `stop_sequences`        | Defines custom termination patterns                             |
| `allow_citations`       | Enables or disables reference lists                             |
| `language_output`       | Sets the language (_English, Turkish, Spanish, French, German_) |

# Meta-Parameters and Composition Metrics

Additional keys provide structural control and traceability:

- `length_in_words`, `paragraph_count` — define text size.
- `include_intro`, `include_conclusion` — toggle framing sections.
- `seed_context` — sets a conceptual origin (e.g., "Entropy.Macro.Cold.Iron").
- `keywords`, `inspiration_source` — specify thematic anchors.

This metadata makes AI writing reproducible and interpretable —
an essential trait for collaborative or academic applications.

# Conclusion: Toward a Machine-Readable Philosophy of Writing

`content-llm-builder-schema.v0.1` represents a new frontier:
not just generating language, but encoding the philosophy of authorship.

It enables AI systems to write with intentionality — to reason, feel, and construct arguments within defined ontological boundaries.
Rather than asking “What can the model write?”, we begin asking:

> “From what worldview, with what rhythm, and under what ethical stance does it write?”

In that sense, this schema is not merely a technical specification —
it is the blueprint for a coming discipline: AI Authoring Standards —
the grammar of machine consciousness in written form.
