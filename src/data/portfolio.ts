Using datasets from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) and NIH PubMed, we developed a lightweight web application that classifies, visualizes, and connects biological studies through an intuitive interface. Our system parses XML data, processes it with a large language model (LLM), and generates structured JSON outputs that feed into three main tools — the Atlas, Knowledge Atlas, and Article Explorer. This approach helps researchers quickly identify relationships between experiments, organs, and biological systems, bridging the gap between raw data and scientific discovery. By integrating 5,000+ articles with over 90% AI classification accuracy, OpenBio Cosmos directly addresses the “Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine” challenge — making space bioscience more accessible, searchable, and connected. It empowers the community to Learn, Launch, and Lead the next era of human space exploration.",
